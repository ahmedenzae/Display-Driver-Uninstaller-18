## Features of Display Driver Uninstaller 18:

Clear-cut interface and options

At startup, Display Driver Uninstaller warns users that it plans to modify Windows registry settings, and recommends them to create a system restore point in order to reset settings to default if any stability issues occur afterward, as well as to restart the computer in safe mode.

The interface is user-friendly, based on a single window with a regular structure, where the app shows the Windows version and lets you select the graphics driver. So, you can ask the tool to clean and restart the PC, do not reboot it, or shut it down completely.

In addition, it can remove the driver folders from the computer, as well as create and save log files in the startup path. It is also possible to set the Windows Automatic Driver installation to default.
